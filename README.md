# Car-Price-Prediction
This GitHub repository showcases my work on predicting car selling prices using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset containing crucial details like the year of manufacture, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner information, the project employs Python with popular libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. The dataset is meticulously processed, with categorical data encoded for compatibility with machine learning models.

The project features the training of two regression models—Linear Regression and Lasso Regression—each evaluated on both training and test datasets. The evaluation metrics, including R squared error, provide insights into the models' performance. Visualization of the predicted versus actual prices using scatter plots enhances the interpretability of the results. The README also includes a concise set of instructions for setting up the required dependencies, facilitating easy replication of the project by other users. This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive resource for those interested in understanding and implementing car price prediction models.
